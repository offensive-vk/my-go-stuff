# What is Go (Golang) ?

*Go*, also known as *Golang*, is a free and open-source programming language designed at Google. It was created to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines, and large codebases. Go is syntactically similar to C but provides memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

Go is widely used for developing efficient and scalable server-side applications. Its simplicity and performance make it an ideal choice for cloud computing, distributed systems, and other performance-critical applications. Go compiles directly to machine code, offering the speed and efficiency of a statically typed, compiled language.

Go supports cross-platform development and allows creating binaries that run without the need for an external runtime. Its built-in tooling includes support for formatting, testing, and dependency management, making it a developer-friendly choice.

Goâ€™s concurrency model, based on goroutines and channels, is one of its standout features, enabling efficient multitasking and parallelism.

The Go compiler and tools are open-source and distributed under the BSD-style license. The development of Go is led by a team at Google, including *Robert Griesemer*, *Rob Pike*, and *Ken Thompson*.
